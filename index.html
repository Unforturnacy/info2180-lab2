                        Learning coding or programming can give you an advantage in understanding what is and is not possible in your job.
                        There are numerous options for learning to code these days. Indeed, with so many different resources available, 
                        it can be difficult to determine which is best for your individual learning <style class=""></style>Python is the 
                        best coding language to start with if you're new to programming. It's a beginner-friendly coding 
                        language with a simplified syntax and fewer lines than other coding languages, making it simple to read, understand,
                         and use.<br><br><br>Python is used for a variety of purposes, including website development (via Django), software 
                         development, and task automation, to name a few.Python is not only simple to learn (in comparison to other coding 
                         languages), but it is also an open-source language, which means that there is a large and thriving community where 
                         anyone can work on and contribute to projects and libraries.
                         In fact, there are an estimated 8 million Python developers, providing you with a global network as you learn 
                         this language.</p>

                    <h2>C++-The Hardest Programming Language to Learn</h2>
                    <p class ="author">September 29, 2022 by Teric Simons</p>
                 
                    <div>

                        C++ is a general-purpose programming language that is an extension of C, which we previously described as an easy 
                        language to learn. C++ is said to be used in the Google Chromium browser, several Microsoft applications, and even 
                        financial modeling at Morgan Stanley,it is difficult to learn because it has a complex syntax to allow for
                        versatility and it is a permissive languageâ€”you can do anything technically possible, even if it is not logically correct.
                        It is best learned by someone with prior experience with C programming. <br><br><br> Game development is a popular 
                        application of C++ at the moment. According to statistics, C++ is still a very popular programming language among game
                         developers. Furthermore, because of its versatility, it is widely used by developers, particularly those with a solid
                        understanding of computer programming.Because of its advanced syntax and multiple paradigm support, learning C++ is 
                        difficult for beginners. Simply put, it might or might not work intuitively. In some cases, it can produce the 
                        desired result, but in others, the developer may encounter a number of errors/bugs, and correcting those bugs 
                        requires a sufficient amount of experience and understanding. As a result, learning C++ takes a long time, and
                         mastering it takes even longer.</p>
